            <h1>Sumit Ray - Aspiring Frontend Developer</h1>
        
            <p>Greetings! I am Sumit Ray, a passionate individual with a keen interest in frontend development. I completed my basic education at V.S Niketan School, where I laid the foundation for my future endeavors.</p>
        
            <p>My journey into the professional world began with a six-month internship at Norvic Hospital, where I gained valuable insights and hands-on experience in a real-world setting. This opportunity honed my skills and provided a practical understanding of the dynamics of the workplace.
        
            <p>One of my proudest achievements is my involvement in a project where my teammate and I successfully collaborated on creating an innovative solution. We dived into the world of technology, utilizing an Arduino Mega and a NODE MCU temperature sensor. This project not only showcased my ability to work collaboratively but also my passion for turning ideas into reality.</p>
        
            <p>Looking ahead, my goal is to specialize in frontend development. I am committed to enhancing user experiences through intuitive and visually appealing interfaces. I am enthusiastic about leveraging my skills to contribute to cutting-edge projects and staying at the forefront of technological advancements.</p>
        
            <p>I am eager to continue expanding my knowledge and skills in the realm of frontend development. With a strong foundation, practical experience, and a commitment to continuous learning, I am poised to make meaningful contributions in the ever-evolving field of web development.</p>
